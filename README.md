## Overview

GRC Engineering is a step change evolution in the practice of information security governance, risk, and compliance (GRC). As a community-led movement, we seek to improve the practice of GRC, to both keep pace with the rapid acceleration in software development spurred by [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org), [DevOps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps), [DevSecOps](https://www.devsecops.org/), [continuous integration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration), [continuous delivery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery), and [continuous deployment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment); and to overcome the limitations of conventional "legacy" GRC practices that have artificially constrained the value that GRC programs can provide to an organization beyond mere compliance and security theater.

## Fundamental problems with Legacy GRC
1. Highly manual processes lead to wasted time and limited effectiveness of GRC practices
2. Tools and processes are designed by and for the GRC team, leading to cumbersome, confusing, and complicated user experiences for stakeholders 
3. Shallow and overly-academic understanding of control design, monitoring, and testing leads to missed opportunities for identifying and solving root cause problems 
4. A culture of endless frameworks reinforces status quo biases and groupthink tendencies, leading to regressive solutions being retrofitted to ever-changing problems 

## Values

- **Automate early on an often** over settling for manual processes
- **Strong bias toward meaningful outcomes** over status quo outputs
- **Evidence, logic, math, and reason** over fear, uncertainty, and doubt
- **In-depth control testing and monitoring** over settling for surface-level details and assumptions
- **Challenging convention** over
- **Systems thinking and organizational engineering**
- **Shared fate collaboration** over command-and-control transactions

## Principles
